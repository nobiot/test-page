Raspberry Pi 4

* Overview
* Installation

The Raspberry Pi 4 is the successor to the Raspberry Pi 3. It builds upon the Pi 3 by upgrading the ARM cores to Cortex-A72, offering up
to 4GB RAM, USB 3.0, and gigabit ethernet.

The Raspberry Pi 4 measures the same 85.60mm x 53.98mm x 17mm, with a little overlap for the SD card and connectors which
project over the edges. The SoC is a Broadcom BCM2711. This contains a quad-core Coretx-A72 running at 1.5GHz and a Videocore VI
GPU.

Note: The Raspberry Pi 4 has higher power requirements than the Raspberry Pi 3. A power supply rated at 3A is the official
recommendation. Using an insufficient power supply will result in random, inexplicable errors and filesystem corruption.

Note: The Raspberry Pi 4's USB Type-C power port is not compliant with the USB Type-C specification, and it will not be able to be
powered by supplies that are compliant.

ARMv7 Installation

Use this installation if you require any of the vendor's kernel hacks, overlays, or closed-source GPU blobs and utilities.

Replace sdX in the following instructions with the device name for the SD card as it appears on your computer.

1 Start fdisk to partition the SD card: 
fdisk /dev/sdX
2 At the fdisk prompt, delete old partitions and create a new one: 

 1 Type o. This will clear out any partitions on the drive. 
 2 Type p to list partitions. There should be no partitions left. 
 3 Type n, then p for primary, 1 for the first partition on the drive, press ENTER to accept the default first sector, then type +200M
 for the last sector. 
 4 Type t, then c to set the first partition to type W95 FAT32 (LBA). 
 5 Type n, then p for primary, 2 for the second partition on the drive, and then press ENTER twice to accept the default first and last
 sector. 
 6 Write the partition table and exit by typing w.

3 Create and mount the FAT filesystem: 
mkfs.vfat /dev/sdX1
mkdir boot
mount /dev/sdX1 boot
4 Create and mount the ext4 filesystem: 
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX2
mkdir root
mount /dev/sdX2 root
5 Download and extract the root filesystem (as root, not via sudo): 
wget http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-4-latest.tar.gz
bsdtar -xpf ArchLinuxARM-rpi-4-latest.tar.gz -C root
sync
6 Move boot files to the first partition: 
mv root/boot/* boot
7 Unmount the two partitions: 
umount boot root
8 Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi, connect ethernet, and apply 5V power. 
9 Use the serial console or SSH to the IP address given to the board by your router. 

 * Login as the default user alarm with the password alarm. 
 * The default root password is root.

10 Initialize the pacman keyring and populate the Arch Linux ARM package signing keys: 
pacman-key --init
pacman-key --populate archlinuxarm

AArch64 Installation

This provides an installation using the mainline kernel and U-Boot. Use this installation only if you have no dependencies on the closed
source vendor libraries shipped in the ARMv7 release. This installation has near full support for the device, including the VC4 graphics.

* Follow the above instructions, substituting with the following tarball: 
http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-aarch64-latest.tar.gz

* Before unmounting the partitions, update /etc/fstab for the different SD block device compared to the Raspberry Pi 3: 
sed -i 's/mmcblk0/mmcblk1/g' root/etc/fstab
