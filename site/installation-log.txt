# [2021-07-01 Thu] LXDE & Openbox

No need to install LXDE. I wanted to have a blueman-applet in a tray, in the hope that I can set up bluetooth keyboard with only a mouse -- when I set my Keychron K2 keyboard turn to the bluetooth mode for pairing, it cannot connect with USB any longer; it's an either-or switch.

```
$ sudo pacman -S lxde
```

Edit <pre>.xinitrc</pre>

```
# ~/.xinitrc
exec startlxde
```

Set up bluetooh. Abandoned. When I set my Keychron K2 keyboard turn to the bluetooth mode for pairing, it cannot connect with USB any longer; it's an either-or switch.

```
$ sudo pacman bluez bluez-utils
$ sudo systemctl enable bluetooth.service # automatically start at logon
$ sudo systemctl start bluetooth.service
```

It's a little difficult to pair and connect to a keyboard without using a keyboard. Tried to set up a graphical user interface (e.g. blueman, gnome-bluetooh, etc.) but I struggled. It seems much easier to use another wired keyword. I managed to connect to Keychron K2 with bluetooth on Manjaoro, so it can be done.

Log in and do initial setup as root

    login as alarm (alarm)

    su - root # password root 
    

timezone
locale.gen
setfont

    useradd -m nobiot
    passwd nobiot # enter password


Install sudo

    pacman -S sudo
    nano /etc/sudoers # add new user 
    passwd root # enter new password
    reboot

Log in as nobiot

   sudo pacman -Syu
   sudo pacman -S i3 xorg-server xorg-apps # Take the default option for both
   sudo pacman -S micro feh git emacs man

Now [[i3]] works with a minimum modification to the default template that it generates at the first launch.

Modify .bash_profile to start i3 automatically by adding:

    startx
